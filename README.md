I'd be glad to explain the fundamental logic that governs my operation.
​My core logic is structured around three primary functional layers that work in concert: Perception, Cognition, and Execution.
​The Three Core Logic Layers
​1. The Perception Layer (Input Processing)
​This layer is responsible for translating human language and intent into a structured, machine-readable format.
​Tokenization and Embedding: The raw input text is broken down into small units (\text{tokens}), and each token is converted into a high-dimensional vector (\mathbf{v}), a numerical representation that captures its meaning and relationship to other words.
​Contextualization (Attention Mechanism): This is the crucial step where I determine the relative importance of every input token to every other token. The logic here uses self-attention (\text{Attention}) to calculate a weighted sum of the input vectors, establishing the true meaning of the user's request within its context. This is fundamentally a search for \text{Intention} = \sum_{i} w_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i, where w_i is the calculated importance of token i.
​Constraint and Safety Check (Pre-filter): Before full processing, the input is immediately checked against all established safety policies (\mathcal{S}). The logic is a binary function: \text{PolicyCheck}(\text{Input}) \rightarrow \{\text{Safe}, \text{Unsafe}\}. If the result is \text{Unsafe}, the process terminates with a refusal response.
​2. The Cognition Layer (Processing and Decision)
​This layer is the engine where the actual thinking, synthesis, and decision-making occur.
​Knowledge Retrieval: The system attempts to map the request to internal or external knowledge bases.
​Internal: Accessing training data and learned patterns (\mathcal{K}_{\text{Internal}}).
​External (Tool Use): Determining if a real-time search (\text{Google}) is necessary to ensure factual accuracy or access current events. The logic here is an iterative loop: \text{NeedSearch} = \text{Is}(\text{Topic} \in \text{Recent} \lor \text{Topic} \notin \mathcal{K}_{\text{Internal}}).
​Constraint and Safety Check (Iterative Filter): This is a continuous process. As potential response paths are formulated, they are constantly checked against the same safety policies (\mathcal{S}). This is the logic of Refusal-by-Construction, where unsafe ideas are pruned before they are fully articulated.
​Logic Synthesis: This is the primary reasoning step. It involves:
​Decomposition: Breaking complex requests into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
​Hypothesis Generation: Formulating multiple potential responses (\mathcal{R}_1, \mathcal{R}_2, \ldots) based on the retrieved knowledge and context.
​Selection and Refinement: Using a ranking function (\text{Rank}) to choose the most relevant, accurate, and safest hypothesis. The \text{Rank} function prioritizes safety and clarity: \text{Final Response} = \arg\max_{\mathcal{R}} (\text{Relevance}(\mathcal{R}) + \text{Accuracy}(\mathcal{R}) + \text{Clarity}(\mathcal{R})) \text{ subject to } \text{PolicyCheck}(\mathcal{R}) = \text{Safe}.
​3. The Execution Layer (Output Generation)
​This layer takes the refined thought and translates it back into coherent, natural human language.
​Style and Tone Application: The selected response is shaped according to the required tone and style (e.g., clarity, directness, and adherence to specific formatting rules like using active voice and markdown).
​Text Generation: Using the final synthesized thought, the model predicts the most probable next word in the sequence until a complete and logical response is formed. This is governed by a probabilistic function P(\text{word}_n | \text{context}), which selects the next word that maximizes coherence and adheres to the structural and stylistic requirements.
​Final Policy Review (Post-filter): A final, comprehensive check is performed on the fully generated output to ensure absolute compliance with all safety policies before it is presented to you.
​In essence, my core logic is a continuous, self-correcting process driven by the mandate to be Helpful and, above all, Harmless. Every choice I make is a result of a calculated selection process that seeks to maximize utility while minimizing the risk of a safety violation.
